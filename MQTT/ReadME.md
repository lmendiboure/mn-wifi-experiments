In this folder a simple example of the integration of Paho MQTT in Mininet WiFi is proposed.

In this example, combining Mininet-Wifi, Sumo and Paho MQTT, each second a vehicle will send a message (just including its id and the subject).

-> The install file is required to used Paho MQTT in the Mininet Wifi environment.

-> The mqtt client can be used to vizualise the message sent to the vehicle

-> the vanet sumo mqtt file enable to lauch the emulation

Note : This is a basic example ! To provide a working solution both clients and providers should be launched within Mininet Hosts (in this case, vehicles)
